# Rock Paper Scissors

This is the boilerplate for the Rock Paper Scissors project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/machine-learning-with-python-projects/rock-paper-scissors

## Rock Paper Scissors
For this challenge, you will create a program to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. A program that picks at random will usually win 50% of the time. To pass this challenge your program must play matches against four different bots, winning at least 60% of the games in each match.

You will be working on this project with our Replit starter code.

We are still developing the interactive instructional part of the machine learning curriculum. For now, you will have to use other resources to learn how to pass this challenge.
